A fun web scraper written in python to scrap car information from

`http://www.cars-data.com/en/sport-cars.html`

# Main screen

## This is how the main screen looks like:

![]()

## I scrape all the links from that page

![]()

## For each page, I scrape all car names and information.

(more on that coming soon)
